\section{Process and Learning:}
I started first to look for the best conference. To do that, I looked into where one of the best papers on my field was published and that was the conference where I decided to use as source to accomplish this assignment.\\ 
As I started working on referencing the documents, I struggled on how to copy and download the papers references at once. It was easy to export the references and citations from the website but downloading the actual documents was a bit challenging; at the end I had to download the documents individually. 
I then had to learn how print-out the references without calling the  citation command, I searched on line and found mostly all the commands that I needed to design this assignment.\\
As I was browsing the articles it started to be more obvious where I should read and look into to find the interesting papers that I should scan.
