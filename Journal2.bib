abstract = {— C-RAN is a mobile network architecture that enables the share of network resources in a centralised data centre, being cost-effective to the operators. This work consists of a study of the impact of C-RAN in an operator's network, namely the latency and the capacity needed per data centre. It is also analysed the costs associated with the implementation of C-RAN, comparing it with the correspondent decentralised network, both in green field. A model was implemented taking as an input the positioning of RRHs and possible BBU Pools available, as well as the costs associated with each component. The model presents four types of connection algorithms based on technical issues in order to test different aspects of the network. Finally, an analysis of Minho is made using typical values for the various delay and capacity contributions. In what concerns to the fronthaul connections, the outcomes illustrate that a microwave link is not cost effective comparing with fibre. It is also shown that the cost savings, comparing a decentralised with a C-RAN architecture, is around 13{\%}. Due to the dimension of the scenarios, the fronthaul costs reveals to be the most expensive component.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Reducing the energy consumed in Clouds is becoming an increasingly challenging research direction due to the exponential growth of services hosted there and delivered. The big concern of data center providers is to find a trade-off between the offered resources and the current traffic load. GreenPOD aims to reduce the consumed energy as well as to satisfy pre-defined response time for fat-tree data center networks by using queuing theory based on mathematical model. GreenPOD considers different activation thresholds based on request queuing to switch ON/OFF different POD which is formed by a certain group of servers when needed. Our results show that GreenPOD outperforms previous energy-aware queuing theoretical model. In respect of a moderately demanded system (resp. highly demanded system), GreenPOD saves up to 61.72{\%} (resp. 47.75{\%}).},

abstract = {In Federated Identity Management, providers from different security domains
exchange messages containing authentication and authorisation credentials
of users. As a result, a user can use his Personal Identifiable Information
(PII) from one or more Identity Providers to gain access to other sites.
Disseminating PII over intermediaries also requires protecting PII from
being misused and unauthorised access. Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS)
provides a federated identity for users to access multiple Cloud services
on demand but may preserve user privacy. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for preserving privacy in IDaaS by combining Purpose Based Access
Control and Attribute-based Encryption with multi-authorities support. Our
approach is suitable for sharing sensitive user information in a large
distributed and heterogeneous environment.},
